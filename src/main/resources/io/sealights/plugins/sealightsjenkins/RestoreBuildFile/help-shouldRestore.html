    SeaLights Jenkins Plugin updates the customer's build file by adding relevant plugins automatically.
    Customers which would like to keep the build file as is, should check this option.
    By checking this option, SeaLights Jenkins Plugin will override the modified build file with a copy of the original one, thus overriding its changes to the file.
